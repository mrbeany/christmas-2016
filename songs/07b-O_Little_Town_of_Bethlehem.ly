  O lit -- tle town of Beth -- le -- hem,
  How still we __ _ see thee lie!
  A -- bove thy deep and dream -- less sleep

  Yet in thy dark streets shin -- eth
  The ev -- er -- last -- ing Light;
  The hopes and fears of all the years
  Are met in thee to -- night.

I thought I could sur -- vive the beast but I guess it ate me up.
I'm deep in -- side this dra -- gon now and I think I feel it's guts.

I thought it would be quite ex -- cit -- ing to vi -- sit dra -- gon's lair.

I saw a pile of iv' -- ry in the lair carved and po -- lished bright.
It seems that when we are spat out we will make some -- thing real nice.
