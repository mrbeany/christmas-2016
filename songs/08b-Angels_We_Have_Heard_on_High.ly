Have you seen the zom -- bie horde?
It is just a zom -- bie horde

Your flesh, my flesh and the dog.
I want to eat the zombies

I want to eat the zombies

Mu -- tu -- al eating, you see.

I would like to eat that dog.
What is wrong with his old knob?
I thought it was just a dog,
but mu -- tants, they're in the hall.
I thought these were just zombies
but these are not zombies.
They are real -- ly mu -- tant beasts.
How can I kill them all?
I thought that these were zombies,
but they are real -- ly strange
hor -- rib -- le mu -- tant beasts.
How do I kill them for sure?

I think it might be real fun,
grab -- bing guns while on the run.
If it's just a vi -- deo game

But, please, don't send me out.
I don't want to die.
I think it is happ' -- ning now.
If it's just a game, but

Please don't let them eat me, no.

I think it might be real nice
eat -- ing flesh and jump -- ing thrice

Mu -- tant pow -- ers, X -- men now.
I think I would like super pow -- ers
if I just got some of that mu -- tant stuff.
May -- be I would not turn.
I would hope that I could be mostly hu -- man,
but if I wasn't, then so~what, I guess.
At least I would be real cool.
