# christmas-2016

Christmas Gifts (of sheet music) for 2016.

This is a collection of songs given to the family members
of the *Mr. Beany's Bitty Band* for Christmas in 2016.
It is composed, exclusively, of new lyrics to established
public domain songs.

*Mr. Beany's Bitty Band* released a free
[Christmas 2016](https://mrbeany.bandcamp.com/album/christmas-2016)
album which features instrumental versions of the songs
contained in this songbook.
            
This would not be possible without Benjamin Bloomfield's 
[Christmas Carols Collection](https://github.com/bbloomf/christmas-carols)
available at
[https://github.com/bbloomf/christmas-carols](https://github.com/bbloomf/christmas-carols)

These songs were written for *Christmas 2016.*

## Compiling

You will need 
[LilyPond](http://lilypond.org/) to compile the source, `.ly`
files in to PDF. It is the only dependency.

To compile the songbook, go to the "book" directory and type:

    lilypond christmas-2016.ly

MIDI files are currently deactivated in each of the song Lilypond files, so there should
be nothing produced other than `christmas-2016.pdf`.

### Compiling an individual song

To compile an individual song, go to the "songs" directory and type:

    lilypond some-song.ly

The MIDI is currently commented out, so if you want that, you'll want to re-enable it.
Just look for the `\midi` line in the file and remove the leading `%`.
